# Contributing to gitconvex

Gitconvex is powered by React JS for the front-end and Golang for the back-end. As the tech stack is different, the project has been split into two public repositories for ease of maintenance. 

- **Frontend repo (React JS)**

[![gitconvex-ui](https://github-readme-stats-git-master.neel1996.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=neel1996&repo=gitconvex-ui)](https://github.com/neel1996/gitconvex-ui)

- **Backend repo (Golang)**

[![gitconvex-server](https://github-readme-stats-git-master.neel1996.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=neel1996&repo=gitconvex-server)](https://github.com/neel1996/gitconvex-server)


# Guidelines 

This repository is a bundle with both the UI and server source code, so the contributions will not be directly accepted here. If you are interested in contributing to the project, then please make it towards the [gitconvex-ui](https://github.com/neel1996/gitconvex-ui) or [gitconvex-server](https://github.com/neel1996/gitconvex-server)

## Branching 

Both the UI and server repos have their own `development` branch which will stay open for contributions. Fork the repo and raise a new pull request from your forked repo to the `development` branch of the actual repo. The PR will be reviewed by the maintainers and it will be merged to the `main` branch.
